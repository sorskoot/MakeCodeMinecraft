# Test

Jekyll has first class support for categories and tags in blog posts. The difference between categories and tags is a category can be part of the URL for a post whereas a tag cannot.

To use these, first set your categories and tags in front matter:

### Code snippet

{% highlight javascript %}
if __name__ =='__main__':
    img_thread = threading.Thread(target=downloadWallpaper)
    img_thread.start()
    st = '\rDownloading Image'
    current = 1
    while img_thread.is_alive():
        sys.stdout.write(st+'.'*((current)%5))
        current=current+1
        time.sleep(0.3)
    img_thread.join()
    print('\nImage of the day downloaded.')
{% endhighlight %}
